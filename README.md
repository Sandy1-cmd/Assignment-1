# Dognition Business Process Recommendations and SMART Goal

## Introduction

Hello, my name is Sandil Nayak. In this presentation, I will outline strategic recommendations and a SMART goal aimed at optimizing business processes for Dognition. These changes are designed to enhance user engagement and improve the overall user experience.

## Recommendations for Business Process Enhancements

1. **Implement Achievement Badges**: Introduce a badge system to incentivize users, encouraging continued engagement and completion of assessments.
   
2. **Targeted Reminder System**: Develop a system for sending personalized reminders to users, particularly at stages where engagement tends to drop.

3. **Social Media Engagement**: Shift from the current "Free Start" promotion to more active social media marketing campaigns to engage potential customers and increase brand visibility.

### SMART Goal: 
- **Objective**: Improve the completion rate of the first 20 tests per subscriber by 10% within the next 3 months.

These recommendations focus on increasing user participation by addressing engagement challenges, drop-off points, and leveraging geographic insights. 

## Geographical Insights

To tailor our marketing strategy more effectively, it’s essential to first understand where the highest concentrations of Dognition customers are located.

### Key Findings:
- **Top Market**: The United States has the largest user base for Dognition, with California leading as the top state.
- **Focus Areas**: Other states with significant user populations include North Carolina, New York, Texas, and Florida.

### Strategy:
Given this information, I recommend prioritizing marketing and sales efforts in California, North Carolina, New York, Texas, and Florida, where the user base is most concentrated.

## Analyzing User Activity: Completion Rates

Understanding when users are most active will help us optimize our engagement strategies.

### Key Insights:
- **Peak Hour**: Users are most active at 7 PM.
- **Peak Day**: Sundays see the highest engagement levels.
- **Peak Month**: October 2014, following Dognition's appearance on "60 Minutes," showed a significant spike in user activity, demonstrating the impact of external publicity on user engagement.

### Implications:
This data suggests the need for targeted reminders at times of peak activity (e.g., Sunday evenings and 7 PM) to maintain engagement and reduce drop-off rates.

## User Behavior and Drop-off Rates

To improve user participation, we must understand where and why users drop off during the assessment process.

### Key Insights:
1. **Free Start Promotion**: The "Free Start" promotion, which offers the first four tests for free, has proven ineffective. Users who received the Free Start promotion dropped off more significantly after the fourth test compared to those who did not receive the offer.
   - **Recommendation**: Discontinue the "Free Start" promotion due to its lack of impact on long-term user engagement.

2. **Completion Rates**: Approximately 23% of users complete 20 tests, which highlights a key opportunity for improvement.
3. **Drop-off at Subcategory Transitions**: The "Eye Contact" game sees the highest drop-off rate. Users tend to disengage after completing subcategories, suggesting that either the tests are becoming too challenging or users lose focus.

### Implications:
This suggests that user fatigue or lack of engagement at certain transition points may be a significant barrier to full test completion. A potential solution could be to introduce short breaks or simplify transitions between subcategories.

## Recommendations for Improving User Engagement

### 1. **Introduce Achievement Badges**
   - **Objective**: Create a badge system to reward users for completing tests. This fosters a sense of accomplishment and motivates continued engagement. Periodic tournaments or competitions can further encourage participation and create community-driven goals.

### 2. **Implement Targeted Reminders**
   - **Objective**: Use data insights to send reminders during key moments—specifically when engagement is low (e.g., after the "Eye Contact" game). These reminders should align with times of peak activity (e.g., 7 PM on Sundays) to maximize effectiveness.

### 3. **Leverage Social Media for Customer Engagement**
   - **Objective**: Since the "Free Start" promotion was not effective, we recommend shifting focus to social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. Sharing fun, educational content and interactive posts featuring dogs can engage potential customers and improve brand presence. This strategy should be most active during peak social media engagement days—Friday through Monday.

## Conclusion

To recap, the key strategies to improve user participation and engagement are:

1. **Achievement Badges**: Foster a sense of accomplishment and encourage users to complete more tests.
2. **Targeted Reminders**: Send personalized reminders during peak activity times and when engagement tends to drop.
3. **Social Media Campaigns**: Transition away from ineffective promotions and focus on building an active, engaging social media presence.

These strategies are designed to boost user engagement, reduce drop-off rates, and ultimately enhance the overall user experience on Dognition’s platform.

Thank you for your attention.
